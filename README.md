# Setup ASL3 Shari <> DVSwitch <> MMDVM Reflector

## Install ASL3 on debian 12 server or pi:

```bash
sudo -s
cd /tmp
wget https://repo.allstarlink.org/public/asl-apt-repos.deb12_all.deb
dpkg -i asl-apt-repos.deb12_all.deb
apt update
apt install asl3
apt install allmon3 (optional, do it if you want the dashboard)
```

## Configure ASL3

 - `asl-menu`

Enter your node settings in the configuration page, pretty much guide yourself on the top of the menu. Save and restart asterisk.

 - `nano /etc/asterisk/simpleusb.conf`

Enter this into the bottom node sectio, node-main section, and general section. Remove the node-main section info before you do this.

```bash
eeprom = 0
hdwtype = 0
rxboost = 0
carrierfrom = usbinvert
ctcssfrom = no
deemphasis = yes
plfilter = no
rxondelay = 5
rxaudiodelay = 10
txmixa = voice
txmixb = no
txboost = 0
invertptt = 0
preemphasis = yes
duplex = 0
```

Afterwards, reboot your node and kerchunk your shari node to see if it worked. The audio is likely low so go back into `asl-menu` and all the way into your node and then hit interface-tune. Hit number 2 and aim for your tramission to be on average hitting the 3KHz. You can adjust the audio levels. Go back and adjust your transmit levels with menu item 3 and 4. Hit W and 0 to exit. Restart asterisk.

Now to test, run `asterisk -r` and then `rpt fun <your node number here> *355553` this connects you to the echotest server, make sure you add your node number in their where it says too! Do a echo tranmission and hope it says audio level is pretty good. If not you can go back and adjust it again. When your done restart asterisk.

## Configure allmon3

 - `nano /etc/allmon3/allmon3.ini`
 - `allmon3-passwd â€“delete allmon3`
 - `allmon3-passwd admin` (create the password for the allmon3 page)
 - `nano /etc/asterisk/manager.conf`

Make your password to be 'password' and then save.

 - `systemctl restart asterisk`
 - `systemctl start allmon3`

Test to make sure it works by going to `http://youripaddress/allmon3` replace youripaddress with the IP address of your node. Run `ip a` to find your ip. Errors? Double check that everything is setup correcty.

## Configure Echolink https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6BJyUns7uU&t=342s

## Install and Configure DVSwitch:

Run `asl-menu` and create a new node called 1999. Select it as no interface. When you see the whole thing go ahead and select the interface to USRP and duplex type to 0 and then HALF.
Restart asterisk and test it. Go to your allmon3 page, login, and connect to node 1999. If it connects then your set. If not then make sure you did everything right.

```bash
wget http://dvswitch.org/bookworm
chmod +x bookworm
./bookworm
apt update
apt install dvswitch-server
```

Configure your DVSwitch:

 - `cd /usr/local/dvs`
 - `./dvs`

Go through the initial configuration and put all your info in. If there are things you don't know then leave them blank.

`nano /opt/Analog_Bridge/Analog_Bridge.ini` Make sure all your details are correct, then under the USRP section make sure it looks like this:

```bash
decoderFallBack = true                  ; Allow software AMBE decoding if a hardware decoder is not found
useEmulator = true                      ; Use the MD380 AMBE emulator for AMBE72 (DMR/YSFN/NXDN)
emulatorAddress = 127.0.0.1:2470

...(many lines here)...

[USRP]
address = 127.0.0.1
txPort = 32001
rxPort = 34001
```

`nano /opt/MMDVM_Bridge/MMDVM_Bridge.ini` Make sure all your details are correct, all the modes are enabled, and change the DMR Network jitter to 750.

Alright you should be set!

```bash
systemctl enable analog_bridge && systemctl enable mmdvm_bridge && systemctl enable md380-emu

systemctl start analog_bridge && systemctl start mmdvm_bridge && systemctl start md380-emu
```

Reboot and let's see if it works. Connect your private node 1999 and then do this.

```bash
/opt/MMDVM_Bridge/dvswitch.sh mode YSF
/opt/MMDVM_Bridge/dvswitch.sh tune parrot.ysfreflector.de:42020
```

When you run the mode command and hear a kerchunk then you know it's working. If you didn't hear that kerchunk and can't get the parrot to make then reboot the node again. If nothing run the status of the analog_bridge and mmdvm_bridge and start troubleshooting. If no results then go get help from the DVSwitch groups.io.

Assuming all is well then lets go ahead and install a DVSwitch mode switcher that is very nice for changing the modes/talkgroups. Follow the instructions found here https://github.com/firealarmss/dvswitch_mode_switcher

## The End

Well it looks like you got everything installed and working. Good job. If you have any issues then feel free to reach out to collin@k0nnk.com or valer24 on discord and I'll try my best to help you out. 73,
